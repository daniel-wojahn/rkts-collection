Far from being a uniform archive, the main body consists of about 60,000 leaves from at least five or six different Kanjur sets that are now mixed, alongside various other canonical fragments.\n\nThe temple was founded by King Jamyang Namgyal ('Jam dbyangs rnam rgyal, r. 1595–1616) and expanded by his son, King Sengge Namgyal (Sengge rnam rgyal, r. 1616–1642), for whom Basgo was a principal residence. The collection spans diverse periods, with its oldest holdings being around 900 folios from the 14th or 15th century, notable for their ancient orthography. The largest portion dates to the early 17th century, linked to the patronage of King Sengge Namgyal and his principal religious authority, the Drukpa Kagyüpa master Taktsang Repa (Stag tshang ras pa, 1574–1651). This major scribal project, likely commissioned after the founding of Hemis Monastery in 1630, involved the scholar Namkha Pelgön (Nam mkha’ dpal mgon, b. ca. 1560) as a reviser for both sutra and tantra sections.\n\nThis 17th-century Kanjur is considered a ‘local’ or ‘independent’ canon. It lacks direct descent from the major Tshalpa or Thempangma transmission lines but shares a nearly identical character with the Hemis Kanjur, suggesting a shared local origin. A portion of the Kanjur was temporarily moved to Phyang Monastery for safekeeping during the Tibet-Ladakh-Mughal War (1679–1684) but was returned incomplete.\n\nIn the 20th century, likely during the 1970s and 1980s, an attempt was made to compile a single, complete Kanjur from the various 17th-century sets. Damaged folios were replaced with new ones of inferior quality, and multiple rounds of re-pagination—with one repair note dated October 25, 1986—indicate repeated efforts to reassemble the texts. The 17th-century manuscripts are notable for their elaborate headmarks (yig mgo) and lack of string holes. While most employ new orthography, some texts retain older forms, like the *mya* conjunct.

    "abstract": "The Bardan Collection is a canonical collection of 9 volumes (incomplete) housed at Bardan Sangngak Chöling Monastery (Ba rdan gsang sngags chos gling dgon pa) in Zanskar. It was founded in the 17th century by Taktsang Repa (Stag tshang ras pa, 1574–1651), who also established Hemis Monastery in Ladakh with the patronage of King Sengge Namgyal (Sengge rnam rgyal, r. 1616–1642). As the first major center of the Drukpa Kagyü school in Zanskar, Bardan holds notable historical importance. The canonical collection was likely compiled or acquired during or after the monastery’s founding to fulfil the ritual and scholastic needs of its community.\n\nThis collection is presently studied by the team of the “Tibetan Manuscripts Project” of the University of Vienna.",

Commissioned by the local ruler, the 11th Coné King Makzor Gönpo (Dmag zor mgon po, 1686–1728?), the project was overseen by Abbot Awang Chile Jiacuo (1688–1738), who had received the title of national preceptor from the Kangxi Emperor (康熙帝, 1654–1722) after visiting the Qing court. While this indicates some Qing influence or patronage, the extent of court involvement is unclear.\n\nScholarly debate surrounds the exact date of the woodblocks: the most cited range is 1721–1731, though dates from 1733–1743 and as late as 1772 are also suggested. The Coné Kanjur was produced in the same era as the Derge Kanjur.\n\nThe edition is based primarily on the Lithang Kanjur (c. 1608–1621) and is considered a faithful copy, making it essential for studying the Lithang text. The editors retained certain linguistic features from Lithang and corrected various errors and omissions. Although the Coné Kanjur follows the structural arrangement of the Peking editions, its textual descent is through Lithang from the Tshalpa manuscript tradition. It could not have been based on the Derge Kanjur, as it was completed earlier; textual similarities arise from their common Lithang ancestry.\n\nThe Coné Kanjur comprises 107 volumes in the traditional loose-leaf pothi format. A well-preserved set, acquired by the Library of Congress in 1926, provides details of its material characteristics: contemporary paper and ink were used for that printing, with wooden covers made in Shanghai in 1927. The paper is yellowish cream, highly absorbent, and the ink is grayish but uneven, reflecting worn woodblocks and lower-quality ink after centuries of use. The volumes measure about 18.5 x 56.5 cm, with eight lines of text per page inside a double-lined frame; foliation appears in a small frame on the left margin of each recto.

The work concluded after five years in 1733. \n\nEditorial supervision was led by Situ Paṇchen Chökyi Jungné (Si tu paṇ chen Chos kyi ’byung gnas, 1700–1774),, an eminent scholar of the period. The team included roughly sixty calligraphers, ten editors, and over four hundred woodcarvers. The editors aimed for a philologically accurate collection, consulting the ’Jang sa tham (Lithang Kanjur, c. 1608–1621), the Thempangma (notably the Lhodzong Kanjur, compiled by Desi Sönam Rabten (Sde srid Bsod nams rab brtan, 1595–1658) in the Thangpoche temple on the advice of the Fifth Dalai Lama), a Kanjur by Ga Anyen Dampa Künga Dragpa (Ga a gnyan dam pa Kun dga’ grags pa, 1230–1303), as well as copies of the Tshalpa Kanjur and perhaps the Old Narthang Kanjur. Stringent procedures ensured accuracy, with three levels of copy-editing and a policy permitting each artisan to carve only one block per day when necessary.\n\nThe Derge Kanjur is principally a representative of the Tshalpa lineage but is noted for its eclectic editorial method, incorporating textual elements and structure from multiple traditions, including the Tantra section arrangement from the Thempangma lineage. This deliberate blending makes the Derge edition both highly authoritative and “contaminated” in modern textual classifications. Its excellence influenced later editions, serving as the basis for the Urga Kanjur, produced in Mongolia in 1910.\n\nThe complete Derge Kanjur typically comprises 103 volumes—102 containing canonical texts and one for the catalog (dkar chag), though some accounts list 104 volumes, counting Situ Paṇchen’s separate catalog. \n\nThe production of the Derge Kanjur and its companion Tanjur secured Derge’s reputation across the Tibetan Buddhist world.

Begun in 1737, the carving of its woodblocks was completed in 1744, with oversight by the king and his successors.

The Shalu Tanjur served as the primary basis, supplemented with comparisons to other collections, including Ga Anyen Dampa Künga Dragpa’s (Ga a gnyan dam pa Kun dga’ grags pa, 1230–1303) Tanjur, the manuscript Tanjurs of the Fourth Zhamarpa, Chödrak Yeshe (Chos grags ye shes, 1453–1524), and Situ Paṇchen Chökyi Jungné (Si tu paṇ chen Chos kyi ’byung gnas, 1700–1774), as well as King Tenpa Tsering’s silver-inscribed manuscript Tanjur.

Zhuchen’s catalogue, commonly known as Chu gter ’phel ba, provides not only an exhaustive index but also historical and editorial insights, making it a critical resource.\n\nThe Derge Tanjur has earned a reputation as one of the finest editions of the Buddhist canon.

Zhuchen’s catalogue, commonly known as Chu gter ’phel ba, provides not only an exhaustive index but also historical and editorial insights, making it a critical resource.\n\nThe Derge Tanjur has earned a reputation as one of the finest editions of the Buddhist canon. Its accuracy and completeness ensured its selection as the base text for the Comparative Edition of the Tanjur (Bstan ’gyur dpe bsdur ma), a monumental project initiated in 1986 by the China Tibetology Research Center to establish a modern authoritative version of the collection.",

Local tradition credits the early-15th-century king of Mustang, Amapal (’A ma dpal, 1388–ca 1445), with establishing a “Temple of Maitreya” here, and some evidence still points to Drakmar as that original site. By the 16th century, Sakya lamas were visiting to teach—and one even served as abbot—attesting a strong Sakyapa affiliation. In the late 17th century, under the influence of the great Nyingma master Orgyen Tenzin (O rgyan bstan ’dzin, 1657–1729) and inspired by the mystic Pargo Lama, the temple adopted Nyingma rituals, installing new images and thangkas of meditation deities.

The structure—mirroring the Tshalpa and Yongle lineages—places Tantras first (24 volumes), followed by Prajñāpāramitā (24), Ratnakūṭa (6), Avataṃsaka (6), Sutras (32), and Vinaya (16). The entire organization adheres to the Tshalpa tradition.\n\nCelebrated for its exquisite production and imperial splendor, this edition has been described as a “National Treasure” and stands as a testament to the close interweaving of religious devotion, artistic achievement, and imperial authority in Qing-era Buddhist culture.",

    "abstract": "The Phugbrag Kanjur is a unique and historically important manuscript edition of the Tibetan Buddhist canon, recognized for its independent textual tradition and distinctive content. The name Phugbrag derives from its home monastery, reportedly built atop a rock (brag) shaped like a pigeon (phug ron); other historical spellings include Spud tra, Phu brag, Spu grags, and Spu brag.\n\nPhugbrag Monastery, located in the Saga (sa dga’) region of Western Tibet and once affiliated with Sera Jé (Se ra byes) Monastery, was founded by Jamyang Lekpa Döndrup (‘Jam dbyangs legs pa don grub), a direct disciple of the First Dalai Lama, Gendun Drup (Dge ‘dun grub, 1391–1474). Although it later became associated with the Gelugpa school, the monastery originally belonged to the Drukpa Kagyü tradition, as seen in the biography of Urgyenpa Rinchen Pel (Grub thob U rgyan pa Rin chen dpal, 1230–1309), who was active at Phugbrag. The monastery received significant official patronage from the government of the Fifth Dalai Lama (1617–1682) and his regent, Desi Sangyé Gyatso (Sde srid Sangs rgyas rgya mtsho, 1653–1705),.\n\nThe Phugbrag Kanjur was sponsored by the abbot Ngawang Chödrak (Ngag dbang Chos grags), aided by the monk Lobsang Tenzin (Blo bzang Bstan ’dzin), the nun Lobsang Wangmo (Blo bzang dbang mo), and local community members. Its catalogue states it was commissioned for the long life of the Sixth Dalai Lama, Tsangyang Gyatso (Tshangs dbyangs rgya mtsho, 1683– after 1706, enthroned 1696), so its compilation dates to the late 17th century. The manuscript is considered a completely independent edition, minimally revised and preserving earlier textual forms.\n\nIts preservation is credited to Sera Jé Tsethang Geshe Kelsang Lhündrup (Se ra byes Rtse thang dge bshes Skal bzang lhun grub), who became abbot around 1940. At that time, the monastery had only about ten monks; by 1959, he had grown the population to over sixty. Just before the events of 1959, he took pains to safeguard the monastery’s treasures. After the uprising, approximately 35 monks fled with the collection to Nubri, Nepal. The process of transferring the collection to the Tibetan Government-in-Exile began in 1967, and by 1971, the Phugbrag collection was housed at the Library of Tibetan Works and Archives (LTWA), Dharamsala. The transferred items included 51 statues , 37 thangkas , and 157 scripture volumes. A microfiche edition was later made for scholarly access.\n\nThe Phugbrag Kanjur contains many unique readings and is not descended from the Narthang manuscript tradition. Unlike Kanjur editions that derive from Chomden Rigpé Raldri’s (Bcom ldan Rig pa’i ral gri, 1227–1305) standard, Phugbrag stands alone as an independent witness. It preserves 30 texts with translation variants—often reflecting earlier renderings compared to the revised versions in other Kanjurs—and uniquely includes an eighth-century translation preserved only here. The Kanjur also contains a rare historical work by Jinamitra on the spread of Buddhism in India, Khotan, and Tibet. While the Sālistamba sūtra (Sa lu’i ljang pa’i mdo) in this collection is closely aligned with the Dunhuang manuscripts, other texts, such as the Druma-kinnara-rāja-paripṛcchā-sūtra, occasionally share variants with the Narthang-derived editions, contributing to ongoing debate about its complex textual affiliations.",

The structure follows the Nyingma nine-vehicle system, in which these tantras are presented as the central texts of the Atiyoga (Great Perfection) class.\n\nThe Anzom Chögar edition is regarded by scholars as closely matching the canonical Derge Nyingma Gyübum (sde dge rnying ma’i rgyud ’bum) version, reflecting a significant editorial and textual lineage.",

    "abstract": "The Seventeen Tantras of the Great Perfection (rdzogs chen rgyud bcu bdun) are foundational scriptures of the Nyingma school, standing at the heart of the Atiyoga or Dzogchen tradition. Among their key canonical witnesses is the woodblock-printed edition produced at Anzom Chögar (A 'dzom chos sgar), a prominent Nyingma monastic center located in Kardze (Dkar mdzes), eastern Tibet.\n\nThis particular edition, comprising four volumes, was created using both woodblock and manuscript methods, and it preserves the full set of Seventeen Tantras as established in classical Nyingma collections. The structure follows the Nyingma nine-vehicle system, in which these tantras are presented as the central texts of the Atiyoga (Great Perfection) class.\n\nThe Anzom Chögar edition is regarded by scholars as closely matching the canonical Derge Nyingma Gyübum (sde dge rnying ma’i rgyud ’bum) version, reflecting a significant editorial and textual lineage.",

This collection, featuring over 1,000 texts, notably includes several gter ma revelations such as Dorjé Lingpa’s (Rdo rje gling pa, 1346–1405) “The Expansive View of the Pha Tantric Cycle” (Pha rgyud lta ba klong yangs) and Northern Treasure (Byang gter) works, while excluding others found in different editions.

Its illuminated successor, Gangtey B, was part of a robust Central Bhutanese tradition including related editions such as Tsamdrak, Tingkyé (Gting skyes), and Rigkdzin Tsewang Norbu’s edition. These manuscripts collectively demonstrate a distinct Bhutanese lineage, linked by shared scribal errors, layout features, and textual agreements, suggesting descent from a common archetype.\n\nDigitally photographed in 2003, the Gangtey (B) manuscript was the first full-color edition of the Nyingma Gyübum, setting a new standard in manuscript preservation and allowing scholars to critically edit texts using pristine images. This collection is an essential witness to Bhutan’s transmission of Tantric literature, preserving rare and ancient readings vital for understanding the history of Tibetan tantric scriptures.",

This manuscript was likely produced in the Solu Khumbu region, Nepal, in the early 19th century, soon after the closely related Nubri set, which was completed in 1813–1814. Its sponsor was Orgyen Trinlé Tenzin (O rgyan ’phrin las bstan ’dzin) of the Nyang clan of Gzhung, a disciple of Drakar Tao Trülku Chökyi Wangchuk (Brag dkar rta so sprul sku Chos kyi dbang phyug, 1775–1837). The Nyang family maintained the main Junbesi temple in Solu Khumbu. The set was later presented to Nepalese Prime Minister Bhim Shumser Jang Bahadur Rana (1875–1932, in office 1929–1932). The Nepal-German Manuscript Preservation Project (NGMPP) microfilmed it in 1989.\n\nClassified as part of the Tibetan-Nepalese Borderlands group of NGB editions, the Kathmandu set was modeled after the Nubri manuscript but shows significant irregularities. Its editorial process was marked by organizational confusion, with inconsistent volume numbering and foliation, indicating difficulties in both planning and execution. Materials, scribal quality, and artistic features vary widely, likely due to resource limitations and use of different craftsmen. After transfer to the National Archives, further disorder ensued as Nepalese librarians unfamiliar with Tibetan added Indian-numeral foliation.\n\nAlthough produced slightly after the Nubri manuscript, the Kathmandu NGB appears to reflect an earlier transmission stage, distinct from major recensions like Tingkyé and Rikdzin Tsewang Norbu's. Its exemplar may have originated from a set brought from Lhodrak Lhalung (Lho brag lha lung), Central Tibet, around 1730.\n\nIntended originally as a 37-volume set, only 35 volumes survive. It contains texts not found in any other known NGB edition, with unique volumes of Dzokchen tantras, paralleling the Nubri set but differing from the Tingkyé edition. The set is notable for inconsistencies in text order and foliation compared to the more uniform Nubri edition.\n\nDespite—or because of—its irregularities, the Kathmandu NGB offers invaluable insight into the practical and textual challenges of compiling large-scale collections in the Tibetan sphere. It preserves a transmission structure reflecting an earlier organizational state, making it a critical resource for the study of the evolution of the Nyingma Gyübum corpus.\n\nThe incomplete set (likely 37 volumes; 35 extant) is stored at the National Archives of Kathmandu (Ms no. 5), microfilmed as NGMPP AT 1/1–AT 25.

    "abstract": "The Tsamdrak Nyingma Gyübum is a 46-volume illuminated manuscript preserved at Tsamdrak monastery (Mtshams brag dgon pa) in Thimphu district, Bhutan. It is widely recognized as one of the most complete and influential witnesses to the Bhutanese transmission of the Nyingma tantric canon.\n\nThe production of the Tsamdrak edition is traditionally credited to Tsamdrak Trülku Ngawang Drukpa (Mtshams brag sprul sku Ngag dbang ’brug pa, 1682–1748), a disciple of Tenzin Legpé Döndrup (Bstan ’dzin legs pa’i don grub) of nearby Gangtey monastery. The likely date of production is between 1726 and 1748. The collection is a part of the Central Bhutanese group of Nyingma Gyübum transmissions, which also includes key sets from Gangtey and Sangyé Ling.\n\nThe Tsamdrak Nyingma Gyübum is noted for its exceptional quality, scribal accuracy, and completeness, comprising 46 substantial volumes and about 1,000 texts. The codicological features include illuminated title folios, gold ink, and meticulous pagination, with consistent volume and folio numbering, double headmarks (yig mgo), and precise layout reflecting the high caliber of the scriptorium.\n\nIts entire textual structure and doxographical sequence precisely match the Gangtey (B) set—both collections are considered “identical twins” (Mayer & Cantwell 2006). The corpus is strictly limited to the three highest classes of Vajrayāna tantras: Mahāyoga, Anuyoga, and Atiyoga, as categorized in the Nyingma tradition. Many additional treasure (gter ma) texts, such as those by Dorjé Lingpa (Rdo rje gling pa, 1346–1405) and from the Northern Treasure (Byang gter) tradition, are present, while notable omissions and inclusions (compared to other editions) reflect the unique editorial history of this version.\n\nTextual criticism shows Tsamdrak and Gangtey (B) to share a common, now-lost ancestor, not standing in a simple parent-child relationship. Both reflect the Bhutanese transmission line, distinct from the Southern Central and Eastern Tibetan recensions. The Bhutanese lines themselves were largely established through the efforts of Lhomön Kathokpa master Sönam Gyaltsen (Lho mon Kaḥ thog pa Bsod nams rgyal mtshan, 1466–1540), Tsültrim Dorjé (Pad gling gsung sprul III Tshul khrims rdo rje, 1598–1669), and subsequent Nyingma hierarchs, who ensured the survival of the corpus through careful copying and transmission during periods of sectarian strife and external threats.\n\nAfter the widespread destruction of religious libraries during the 20th century, the Tsamdrak edition was published by photo-offset lithography in Delhi (1981) with sponsorship from Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, the National Library of Bhutan, and with scholarly guidance from Lopön Pemala. This edition, since reproduced on microfiche, in Western-style bindings, in Chengdu, and digitally by the TBRC and the Tibetan and Himalayan Library, was a milestone for securing the preservation and international accessibility of the Nyingma canon at a time when it faced potential loss.\n\nThe entire Tsamdrak edition has now been digitized and catalogued as part of the Endangered Archives Programme’s EAP310-4-1 project (https://eap.bl.uk/collection/EAP310-4-1).",

Waddell, who took it from Tibet in 1904. Contemporary scholarship identifies its patron as Kathok Tsewang Norbu (Kaḥ thog Tshe dbang nor bu, 1698–1755), a renowned 18th-century lama whose miniature portrait and homage appear on the illuminated opening folio of most volumes.\n\nThe manuscript's origins are closely linked to the vibrant Nyingma scriptural revival in the borderlands of southern Tibet and Nepal, particularly the Kyirong (Skyid grong) region, in the late 18th century. Tsewang Norbu, although nominally based at Kathok in eastern Tibet, traveled extensively, restored monasteries in the Kathmandu Valley, and died in Kyirong. The edition likely arose as part of the revival movement led by his student Trinlé Düjom (Phrin las bdud ’joms, 1726–1789), whose disciples produced several manuscript collections of the Nyingma Gyübum in the area after their master’s death.\n\nInternal evidence for this milieu includes the presence of a certain Nya Sönam Chöphel (Snya bsod nams chos ’phel)—possibly the artist—in the opening volume, with “snya” likely referring to Gnya' nang, near Kyirong. The lama-artist Künsang Trinlé Wangchuk of Kyirong (Kun bzang phrin las dbang phyug, 1772–1812)—a disciple of Trinlé Düjom—was active in producing manuscript frontispieces for the Nyingma canon during this period.\n\nThe surviving manuscript is incomplete, believed to have originally comprised 33 volumes but now existing in 29 volumes, distributed primarily among the British Library (29 vols.), Bodleian Libraries, Oxford (vol. Ka), and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London (two title folios). It is a principal exemplar of the South-Western Tibetan recension, sharing features with the Tingkyé manuscript and Bathang Kanjur (Newark).

    "abstract": "The Lithang Kanjur (also known as the ‘Jang sa tham Kanjur) is a foundational early 17th-century xylographic edition of the Tibetan Buddhist canon. Its dual name derives from the production of its woodblocks in ‘Jang sa tham (capital of the Kingdom of Jang) and their subsequent relocation by Mongolian forces to Lithang Monastery (li thang), Kham.\n\nCommissioned under King Mu Zeng (Mu tseng; 木增, 1587–1646), the project began on the 8th day of the 4th lunar month in 1608. The king requested an exemplar of the Tshalpa Kanjur from the 6th Shamarpa, Garwang Chökyi Wangchuk (Gar dbang Chos kyi dbang phyug, 1584–1630), a major figure in the Karma Kagyü school. The printing of the set was completed in 1621; a Chinese preface was added by Mu Zeng in 1623. The transfer of the blocks to Lithang occurred when Mongolian troops under Dar rgyal bo shog thus—a grandson of Gushri Khan (1582–1655)—seized them, reflecting the political-religious transformation toward Gelukpa authority before 1698. The blocks were physically seen in Lithang by Jacques Bacot in 1909, despite earlier reports of their destruction by fire in 1908.\n\nThe Lithang Kanjur is a revised edition within the Tshalpa lineage. Its main exemplar was the Tshalpa manuscript from Chingwa Taktse (‘Phying ba stag rtse). The source manuscript had undergone successive corrections by prominent scholars, including the heads of the Karmapa, Gö Lotsāwa Shönnu Pel (‘Gos lo tsā ba Gzhon nu dpal, 1392–1481), Pawo II Tsuklak Trengwa (Dpa’ bo Gtsug lag phreng ba, 1504–1566), and several Sharmarpa. The Lithang Kanjur preserves original colophons by Gyalsey Jangchub Palden from the Tshalpa compilation. The arrangement of the texts in Lithang largely follows the Records of Teachings Received (gsan yig) of Pawo Tsuklag Trengwa, with structural innovations and corrections reflecting centuries of editorial revision.\n\nThe Lithang Kanjur comprises 108 volumes. Its structure places the Mdo (Sūtra) section first, followed by the Rgyud (Tantra) section, like the Derge, Narthang, and Lhasa editions, and in contrast to the Peking and Coné editions (which lead with Tantra). Within the Tantra section, the order of texts closely matches the Peking Kanjur—a key link to the Tshalpa manuscript tradition. Noteworthy is the inclusion of a Gzungs ‘dus collection (dhāraṇī), compiled by Buton Rinchen Drup (Bu ston rin chen grub, 1290–1364); this section is absent from the Derge, Narthang, and Lhasa editions but present in Peking and Coné.\n\nThe Lithang Kanjur holds a special place as the first xylographic Kanjur produced within Tibet and as the editorial basis for later widely used editions. Its production during a time of civil war and sectarian tension underscores the canon’s role in both religious and political legitimacy. The edition’s history—particularly the seizure and relocation of its blocks—reflects the interplay of political power and religious tradition during a pivotal era in Tibetan history.",

    "abstract": "The London Kanjur—sometimes called the Shel dkar Manuscript Kanjur—is a principal manuscript witness for the Thempangma lineage of the Tibetan Kanjur. It is preserved at the British Library (Or. 6724) and derives its alternative name from its origins at Shelkar Chödé (Shel dkar Chos sde), a Gelukpa monastery in Latö (La stod), Southern Tibet.\n\nCopied directly from the Shelkar Chödé master manuscript, its production began in the early 18th century and was completed in 1712 (Water-Dragon year, chu ‘brug). The project was a major collaborative effort, involving thirty calligraphers from Némo (sne mo), editorial oversight by ten Shelkar monks, and sponsorship from lay donors including Rdo legs rnam rgyal, with notable support from female patrons Byams pa dpal mo (nun) and Bstan ‘dzin dpal mo. The completed set was consecrated by Shelkar monks, and associated artworks were consecrated by the Fifth Panchen Lama, Lobsang Yeshe (Blo bzang ye shes, 1663–1737), situating the project firmly in this historical period.\n\nThe manuscript brought to the West by L. A. Waddell during the British expedition of 1903–1904, now housed in London, at the British Library, preserved on microfilm. Several volumes are also held by the Bodleian Libraries, Oxford.\n\nThe London Kanjur’s production history is richly documented in three poetic catalogues, which detail its patrons and scribe team and celebrate the spiritual merit of the project. Its Thempangma affiliations, established by Helmut Eimer and confirmed by Peter Skilling, correct prior misattributions to the Tshalpa lineage.\n\nWhile largely faithful to its lineage, the London Manuscript Kanjur shows occasional textual influences from Western Tibetan sources, hinting at editorial engagement with readings beyond strict Thempangma tradition. Its catalogues, rather than being mere indexes, provide unique literary background on the collection’s creation.",

    "abstract": "The London Kanjur—sometimes called the Shel dkar Manuscript Kanjur—is a principal manuscript witness for the Thempangma lineage of the Tibetan Kanjur. It is preserved at the British Library (Or. 6724) and derives its alternative name from its origins at Shelkar Chödé (Shel dkar Chos sde), a Gelukpa monastery in Latö (La stod), Southern Tibet.\n\nCopied directly from the Shelkar Chödé master manuscript, its production began in the early 18th century and was completed in 1712 (Water-Dragon year, chu ‘brug). The project was a major collaborative effort, involving thirty calligraphers from Némo (sne mo), editorial oversight by ten Shelkar monks, and sponsorship from lay donors including Rdo legs rnam rgyal, with notable support from female patrons Byams pa dpal mo (nun) and Bstan ‘dzin dpal mo. The completed set was consecrated by Shelkar monks, and associated artworks were consecrated by the Fifth Panchen Lama, Lobsang Yeshe (Blo bzang ye shes, 1663–1737), situating the project firmly in this historical period.\n\nThe manuscript brought to the West by L. A. Waddell during the British expedition of 1903–1904, now housed in London, at the British Library, preserved on microfilm. Several volumes are also held by the Bodleian Libraries, Oxford.\n\nThe London Kanjur’s production history is richly documented in three poetic catalogues, which detail its patrons and scribe team and celebrate the spiritual merit of the project. Its Thempangma affiliations, established by Helmut Eimer and confirmed by Peter Skilling, correct prior misattributions to the Tshalpa lineage.\n\nWhile largely faithful to its lineage, the London Manuscript Kanjur shows occasional textual influences from Western Tibetan sources, hinting at editorial engagement with readings beyond strict Thempangma tradition. Its catalogues, rather than being mere indexes, provide unique literary background on the collection’s creation.",

    "abstract": "The Matho Canonical Collection is among the most significant finds of early West Tibetan Buddhist literature. They comprise numerous fragmentary manuscripts, mainly from the 11th and 12th centuries.\n\nDiscovered in 2014 at Matho (Mang spro), Ladakh, the fragments surfaced when a group of stupas (mchod rten) was demolished on a plateau near the village. Most were recovered from the \"King's stupa\" (rgyal po’i mchod rten), likely built in the 12th century; a thangka from within, dated to the 12th or early 13th century, supports this context. The fragments are thought to be the remains of the library of nearby Nyarma Monastery, founded by the translator Rinchen Zangpo (Rin chen bzang po, 958–1055), a pivotal center for the second diffusion of Buddhism in Tibet around 1000 CE. It is hypothesized that Nyarma monks deposited worn manuscripts in the stupa, possibly as part of royal funerary rites.\n\nThe fragmentary material cannot be fully reconstructed but clearly represents a proto-Kanjur collection—compiled before the standardized Tibetan canon emerged.

The fragments encompass:\n\n- Canonical texts later included in Kanjur and Tanjur editions\n- Numerous non-canonical works: ritual texts, pūja manuals, practice guides (khrid yig), pith instructions (man ngag), eulogies (bstod), and philosophical commentaries, some possibly local\n- Tantric texts paralleling those in the Basgo Kanjur, suggesting a distinct regional transmission line \n\nThe Matho Collection include both paper and birch bark manuscripts, with the latter possibly Kashmiri and predating the paper items. They appear in both loose-leaf and stitched-booklet forms. Folio size varies widely, from small pieces to large sheets (18–20 × 60–65 cm), matching the \"standard Kanjur\" format seen later. Some large sheets were even cut in half prior to use. The fragments are written in both Uchen and Umé scripts and consistently exhibit features of Old Tibetan orthography: use of subscribed ya (ma ya btags) in syllables, da drag final clusters, and the gi gu log vowel sign.\n\nThese are the oldest Buddhist manuscripts yet found in Ladakh. They offer a direct window into the diversity of Buddhist scripture circulating in Western Tibet during the 11th–12th centuries and document a stage of textual transmission prior to the formalization of the Tibetan Buddhist canon.

The project was commissioned by Kangxi Emperor (康熙帝, 1654–1722) of the Qing dynasty. Woodblock engraving took place in Beijing between 1718 and 1720, with printing completed by the third month of 1720. The edition reflected the Qing court’s commitment to Tibetan Buddhism, which it used to bolster ties with its Mongol subjects. The work involved Tibetan, Mongolian, Chinese, and Manchu scholars and artisans, many resident in or summoned to the Qing capital.\n\nThe editorial team relied on the earlier Mongolian manuscript translation ordered by Ligdan Khan (1604–1634), completed in 1628–1629. Scholars fluent in Tibetan and Mongolian revised this text, collating it with a Tibetan Kanjur for accuracy. The structure of the canon followed the Beijing Tibetan Kanjur edition of 1684–1692. Editing of the Mongolian Kanjur happened alongside corrections to the Tibetan Kanjur in Beijing, evidenced by the simultaneous inclusion of texts such as the Vidyutprāptaparipṛcchā and the Bhadrapālaśreṣṭhiparipṛcchā in both canons between 1700 and 1720.\n\nPhysically, the Mongolian Printed Kanjur resembles contemporary Tibetan blockprints but is adapted for Mongolian script. It uses the traditional Indian pothi format—loose, oblong folios—printed on relatively soft paper, often multi-layered and made from paper mulberry, bamboo, and jute. The text is printed from woodblocks in black and red ink, oriented vertically.\n\nThe 1718–1720 Beijing Kanjur was widely distributed and became the standard version for both study and liturgy throughout Mongolian regions. Its publication marked the culmination of a century-long translation effort and affirmed the Qing dynasty’s patronage of Tibetan Buddhism, symbolizing Mongolian religious and cultural identity.",

The edition reflected the Qing court’s commitment to Tibetan Buddhism, which it used to bolster ties with its Mongol subjects. The work involved Tibetan, Mongolian, Chinese, and Manchu scholars and artisans, many resident in or summoned to the Qing capital.\n\nThe editorial team relied on the earlier Mongolian manuscript translation ordered by Ligdan Khan (1604–1634), completed in 1628–1629. Scholars fluent in Tibetan and Mongolian revised this text, collating it with a Tibetan Kanjur for accuracy. The structure of the canon followed the Beijing Tibetan Kanjur edition of 1684–1692. Editing of the Mongolian Kanjur happened alongside corrections to the Tibetan Kanjur in Beijing, evidenced by the simultaneous inclusion of texts such as the Vidyutprāptaparipṛcchā and the Bhadrapālaśreṣṭhiparipṛcchā in both canons between 1700 and 1720.\n\nPhysically, the Mongolian Printed Kanjur resembles contemporary Tibetan blockprints but is adapted for Mongolian script. It uses the traditional Indian pothi format—loose, oblong folios—printed on relatively soft paper, often multi-layered and made from paper mulberry, bamboo, and jute. The text is printed from woodblocks in black and red ink, oriented vertically.\n\nThe 1718–1720 Beijing Kanjur was widely distributed and became the standard version for both study and liturgy throughout Mongolian regions. Its publication marked the culmination of a century-long translation effort and affirmed the Qing dynasty’s patronage of Tibetan Buddhism, symbolizing Mongolian religious and cultural identity.",

Housed in the Dzamlha Lhakhang of Narthang, this collection marked the introduction of the terms \"Kanjur\" and \"Tanjur\" in Tibet. The manuscript Tanjur served as the model for later influential editions, notably the Shalu Tanjur, edited by Butön Rinchen Drup (Bu ston rin chen grub, 1290–1364).\n\nThe renowned Narthang xylograph edition of the Tanjur was the outcome of a state-sponsored project commissioned by Pholané Sönam Tobgyal (Pho lha nas bsod nams stobs rgyas, 1689–1747), the de facto ruler of Tibet. This work followed the completion of the Narthang Kanjur (1730–1732) by nearly a decade, emphasizing the independence of the two projects.

    "abstract": "The Newark Kanjur, also called the Bathang Kanjur fragment (’ba’ thang bka’ ’gyur), is a significant handwritten local Kanjur from Eastern Tibet, now in the Newark Museum, New Jersey, as part of the Shelton Collection. Scholars generally date it to the 15th or 16th century, though its precise age is undetermined. As a local Kanjur, it represents the unique collection of a single monastery, rather than a standardized, widely published edition.\n\nThe manuscript originated in Bathang, a town in the Kham region near the historical Tibet-China border. Its survival is directly linked to the 1905 destruction of the Gelukpa monastery, Ba Chöde Ganden Phandeling (’Ba’ chos sde dga' ldan phan bde gling), by Chinese forces. After the monastery's library was dispersed, Dr. Albert L. Shelton (1875–1922), an American missionary physician, obtained several of the displaced volumes. In 1920, Shelton donated 24 handwritten Tibetan volumes to the Newark Museum. Flora Beal Shelton (1875–1962), his widow, later described their rescue.\n\nThe museum cataloged the 24 volumes as accession numbers 20.468 to 20.491, though one part of the Prajñāpāramitā was initially filed under a different collection, causing some confusion. Eleanor Olson (1913–1976), author of the Newark Museum’s Tibetan Collection catalogue, was the first to organize the collection. She recognized that colored silk tags sewn to the title pages carried abbreviated titles corresponding to major Kanjur sections, letting her classify them as Vinaya, Sūtra, Abhidharma, and Tantra.\n\nPeter Skilling conducted the first detailed scholarly study, examining the volumes in 1992 and publishing an inventory in 2001. His report covered 23 volumes, as the last was not located at the time.\nHelmut Eimer's 2012 study compared the Newark Collection’s Buddhāvataṃsakasūtra with the Derge edition, to illuminate similarities and differences. He concluded that the Newark Collection’s Sūtra division displays a distinctive text order and arrangement. It includes what appears to be a unique, possibly early, translation of the Tathāgatagarbhasūtra, predating widespread standardization in the ninth century. The manuscript is valued for its independent readings, which scholars can use to trace textual history, even if it occasionally features errors or low-quality variants compared to other Kanjurs.\n\nThe manuscript is written on both sides of the folios, which measure about 7 x 22–26 inches (17.78 x 55.88–66.04 cm), and lacks original covers. Titles and volume numbers appear on silk flaps attached to each volume.\nSome volumes include a table of contents at the end, a trait seen in earlier, less-standardized Tibetan canonical collections rather than the later standardized Kanjurs, revealing the Newark Collection's transitional or regional character.",

After the monastery's library was dispersed, Dr. Albert L. Shelton (1875–1922), an American missionary physician, obtained several of the displaced volumes. In 1920, Shelton donated 24 handwritten Tibetan volumes to the Newark Museum. Flora Beal Shelton (1875–1962), his widow, later described their rescue.\n\nThe museum cataloged the 24 volumes as accession numbers 20.468 to 20.491, though one part of the Prajñāpāramitā was initially filed under a different collection, causing some confusion. Eleanor Olson (1913–1976), author of the Newark Museum’s Tibetan Collection catalogue, was the first to organize the collection. She recognized that colored silk tags sewn to the title pages carried abbreviated titles corresponding to major Kanjur sections, letting her classify them as Vinaya, Sūtra, Abhidharma, and Tantra.\n\nPeter Skilling conducted the first detailed scholarly study, examining the volumes in 1992 and publishing an inventory in 2001. His report covered 23 volumes, as the last was not located at the time.\nHelmut Eimer's 2012 study compared the Newark Collection’s Buddhāvataṃsakasūtra with the Derge edition, to illuminate similarities and differences. He concluded that the Newark Collection’s Sūtra division displays a distinctive text order and arrangement. It includes what appears to be a unique, possibly early, translation of the Tathāgatagarbhasūtra, predating widespread standardization in the ninth century. The manuscript is valued for its independent readings, which scholars can use to trace textual history, even if it occasionally features errors or low-quality variants compared to other Kanjurs.\n\nThe manuscript is written on both sides of the folios, which measure about 7 x 22–26 inches (17.78 x 55.88–66.04 cm), and lacks original covers. Titles and volume numbers appear on silk flaps attached to each volume.\nSome volumes include a table of contents at the end, a trait seen in earlier, less-standardized Tibetan canonical collections rather than the later standardized Kanjurs, revealing the Newark Collection's transitional or regional character.",

    "abstract": "The Tawang Kanjur refers to two manuscript collections of the Tibetan Buddhist canon kept at Tawang Monastery (Dga' ldan rnam rgyal lha rtse) in Arunachal Pradesh, India: a 103-volume handwritten Kanjur (Bka’ ‘gyur skya chos) and an incomplete gold and silver illuminated Kanjur (Bka’ ‘gyur gser chos) with 86 surviving volumes. Both originated at Orgyen Ling Monastery (O rgyan gling dgon pa) in the Mon region of Tibet and are also called the Orgyen Ling Kanjur. These manuscripts are a unique \"locally compiled edition\" within Tibetan canonical transmission.\n\nThe history of the Tawang Kanjur is inseparable from the political and religious upheavals of early eighteenth-century Tibet. Orgyen Ling, the source of these collections, was the birthplace monastery of the Sixth Dalai Lama, Tsangyang Gyatso (Tshangs dbyangs rgya mtsho, 1683–1706). After the death of the Fifth Dalai Lama (1617–1682), Orgyen Ling was destroyed—sources attribute this either to the Dzungar Mongols (who occupied Tibet 1717–1720) or to sectarian attacks on Nyingma monasteries. The Dzungars, known for banning and destroying Nyingma establishments, contributed to this devastation.\n\nDuring or after this destruction, statues, scriptures, and silver stupas from Orgyen Ling were transferred to Tawang Monastery, established in 1680 as the Gelukpa center of Monyul. An official document formalized the transfer and inventory of these materials at Tawang.\n\nThe handwritten Kanjur was commissioned in 1699 by Desi Sangyé Gyatso (Sde srid Sangs rgyas rgya mtsho, 1653–1705), regent of Tibet, and completed before the eighth day of the sixth month of 1700. Written in black ink on thick paper, many volumes bear the signatures of their scribes.\n\nThe gold and silver illuminated Kanjur predates the handwritten collection, though its exact date is uncertain. It is written on thick, black-coated paper with alternating lines of gold and silver, and displays archaic orthographic features such as \"myi\" for \"mi\" and \"stsogs\" for \"sogs.\" Larger volumes measure 29×72 cm with four lines each of gold and silver; smaller ones, 19×72 cm with three lines of gold and four lines of silver per page. Each volume weighs about 10 kg.\n\nManuscripts were transferred to Tawang after 1717–1720, following the Dzungar occupation. In 1731, Miwang Pholané Sönam Tobgyel (Mi dbang Pho lha nas Bsod nams stobs rgyal, r. 1728–1747) issued an edict reinforcing Tawang’s custodianship of these texts. The collections have remained at Tawang Monastery (Galden Namgyal Lhatse) since their arrival. They were surveyed in 1989 by the Central Institute of Tibetan Higher Studies, Sarnath.\n\nThe Tawang Kanjur is notable for its unusually extensive inclusion of Nyingma tantric texts (rnying ma’i rgyud), making it almost a hybrid between a standard Kanjur and a Nyingma tantra collection—unlike mainstream Kanjur editions, which usually contain very few Nyingma works. The handwritten set has 103 volumes; the gold and silver set likely had a similar number, though only 86 survive. The Tawang stock register records 89 volumes of the gser chos in good condition, and 5 in damaged condition, showing the collection was already incomplete when received.\n\nAs a locally compiled edition, the Tawang Kanjur differs in its readings and arrangement from both major transmission lines (Tshalpa and Thempangma), reflecting the local editorial tradition of Mon.",

    "abstract": "The 1737 Peking Kanjur, also known as the Qianlong Kanjur, is a major woodblock-printed edition, produced under the patronage of the Qianlong emperor (乾隆, r. 1735–1796) of the Qing dynasty. It comprises 107 volumes plus an index and was printed in red ink. The Qianlong edition is not a new textual redaction, but a reprinting from established xylographs. The original blocks were carved for the Yongle Kanjur in 1410, based on the Tshalpa tradition. The 1737 edition used the second set of woodblocks commissioned for the Peking Kanjur under the Kangxi Emperor (康熙帝, 1654–1722), originally carved between 1684 and 1692. These same blocks were used for earlier Kangxi editions (1700, 1717–1720) and the Qianlong edition, with occasional corrections and minor changes. Consequently, the so-called “Peking group” block-print editions are nearly identical, with each subsequent print descended from the same source blocks or their direct impressions.\n\nThe Qianlong Kanjur belongs to the Peking branch of the “Eastern group” of Kanjur transmission. Scholarly analysis confirms that the 1737 Qianlong edition is “almost identical” to the preceding 1717–1720 Kangxi edition. Its reliability and completeness led modern editors to use the Qianlong print to restore missing parts in the photolithographic reprint “The Tibetan Tripitaka: Peking Edition” (Japan, 1955), which otherwise used the 1717–1720 blocks.\n\nA unique feature of the 1737 Qianlong edition is the inclusion of an additional colophon, specifically attached to the text ““The Great King of Contemplations Called ‘Nondual Equanimity that Perfectly Conquers’” (Gnyis su med pa mnyam pa nyid rnam par rgyal ba zhes bya ba’i rtog pa’i rgyal po chen po), expressly dated to the Qianlong emperor’s second regnal year.",

It comprises 107 volumes plus an index and was printed in red ink. The Qianlong edition is not a new textual redaction, but a reprinting from established xylographs. The original blocks were carved for the Yongle Kanjur in 1410, based on the Tshalpa tradition. The 1737 edition used the second set of woodblocks commissioned for the Peking Kanjur under the Kangxi Emperor (康熙帝, 1654–1722), originally carved between 1684 and 1692. These same blocks were used for earlier Kangxi editions (1700, 1717–1720) and the Qianlong edition, with occasional corrections and minor changes. Consequently, the so-called “Peking group” block-print editions are nearly identical, with each subsequent print descended from the same source blocks or their direct impressions.\n\nThe Qianlong Kanjur belongs to the Peking branch of the “Eastern group” of Kanjur transmission. Scholarly analysis confirms that the 1737 Qianlong edition is “almost identical” to the preceding 1717–1720 Kangxi edition. Its reliability and completeness led modern editors to use the Qianlong print to restore missing parts in the photolithographic reprint “The Tibetan Tripitaka: Peking Edition” (Japan, 1955), which otherwise used the 1717–1720 blocks.\n\nA unique feature of the 1737 Qianlong edition is the inclusion of an additional colophon, specifically attached to the text ““The Great King of Contemplations Called ‘Nondual Equanimity that Perfectly Conquers’” (Gnyis su med pa mnyam pa nyid rnam par rgyal ba zhes bya ba’i rtog pa’i rgyal po chen po), expressly dated to the Qianlong emperor’s second regnal year.",

    "abstract": "The Stog Palace Kanjur is a complete manuscript edition of the Tibetan Buddhist canon, kept in the royal residence at Stog, Ladakh. It is an important witness to the Thempangma transmission lineage.\n\nProduced in the first half of the 18th century, likely around 1729, the Stog Kanjur was commissioned under the patronage of King Nyima Namgyal (Nyi ma rnam rgyal, r. 1691–1729), with the chief minister, Sönam Lhundrup (Bsod nams lhun grub), procuring a Kanjur manuscript from Bhutan and commissioning a new copy as an act of religious merit for the king’s long life—or, according to oral tradition, for his funeral rites. The Bhutanese exemplar likely reached Ladakh through the First Sela Jamgon Ngawang Gyaltsen (Se’u la Byams mgon Ngag dbang rgya mtshan, 1647–1732), the king’s chief spiritual adviser, underscoring close Ladakhi-Bhutanese religious ties.\n\nThe Stog Kanjur is a direct manuscript copy of its Bhutanese source, possibly produced by four scribes, judging by calligraphic evidence. In the 20th century, the manuscript was published in an offset edition (109 vols.) by T. Namgyal Tarusergar in Leh (1975–1980). Skorupski’s 1985 catalogue remains the definitive reference.\n\nThough closely related to the Thempangma, Stog exhibits unique features, notably in section order: the Buddhāvatamsaka and Mahāratnakūṭa sections are placed within Prajñāpāramitā, not after it, and both the Vinaya and Tantra sections show distinct arrangements. Despite such differences, the manuscript is recognized for careful orthographic regularization.\n\nThe Stog Palace Kanjur is crucial for the study of the Tibetan canon’s transmission, especially as one of the most complete and accessible Thempangma manuscripts. Its relationship with the Shey Palace Kanjur documents the development of a distinct Ladakhi branch of the tradition.",

    "abstract": "The Stog Palace Kanjur is a complete manuscript edition of the Tibetan Buddhist canon, kept in the royal residence at Stog, Ladakh. It is an important witness to the Thempangma transmission lineage.\n\nProduced in the first half of the 18th century, likely around 1729, the Stog Kanjur was commissioned under the patronage of King Nyima Namgyal (Nyi ma rnam rgyal, r. 1691–1729), with the chief minister, Sönam Lhundrup (Bsod nams lhun grub), procuring a Kanjur manuscript from Bhutan and commissioning a new copy as an act of religious merit for the king’s long life—or, according to oral tradition, for his funeral rites. The Bhutanese exemplar likely reached Ladakh through the First Sela Jamgon Ngawang Gyaltsen (Se’u la Byams mgon Ngag dbang rgya mtshan, 1647–1732), the king’s chief spiritual adviser, underscoring close Ladakhi-Bhutanese religious ties.\n\nThe Stog Kanjur is a direct manuscript copy of its Bhutanese source, possibly produced by four scribes, judging by calligraphic evidence. In the 20th century, the manuscript was published in an offset edition (109 vols.) by T. Namgyal Tarusergar in Leh (1975–1980). Skorupski’s 1985 catalogue remains the definitive reference.\n\nThough closely related to the Thempangma, Stog exhibits unique features, notably in section order: the Buddhāvatamsaka and Mahāratnakūṭa sections are placed within Prajñāpāramitā, not after it, and both the Vinaya and Tantra sections show distinct arrangements. Despite such differences, the manuscript is recognized for careful orthographic regularization.\n\nThe Stog Palace Kanjur is crucial for the study of the Tibetan canon’s transmission, especially as one of the most complete and accessible Thempangma manuscripts. Its relationship with the Shey Palace Kanjur documents the development of a distinct Ladakhi branch of the tradition.",

Although still housed at Nesar for decades, the recently renovated Serkhang Temple is beginning to host some of these volumes again. Research, particularly by Klaus-Dieter Mathes, has underlined the close connection between the libraries of Serkhang, Nesar, and Lang.\n\nInitial documentation of the Serkhang Collection was carried out by Amy Heller in 2009, who inventoried seventy-one volumes at Nesar Monastery. In 2014, the head lama of Nesar, Tenzin Gyaltsen (Bstan ‘dzin rgyal mtshan), provided photographs of eighty-eight volumes believed to represent a complete Kanjur, but later analysis revealed this \"Dolpo Kanjur\" actually comprised volumes from three different monastic collections. This prompted an effort to catalogue and digitize each collection—Nesar, Lang, and Serkhang—separately. The Tibetan Manuscript Project Vienna (TMPV) completed digitization of the Serkhang Collection in May 2024. Out of the seventy-one volumes noted by Heller, fifty-seven were photographed. Fourteen volumes, mostly smaller historiographical and ritual texts (T56–T71 in Heller's handlist), were not digitized as they are in ongoing ritual use and have been distributed to various locations, including the restored Serkhang Temple. Additional fieldwork in 2024 identified and digitized an Abhidharma commentary not previously listed.\n\nThe Serkhang Collection is exceptional for the absence of a Sutra collection and for its unique textual profile compared to other Dolpo libraries. It includes fourteen Vinaya volumes, notable as these are missing from other documented Dolpo collections and represent fragments from two different sets. The collection also holds several volumes of the Śatasāhasrikāprajñāpāramitā and Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikāprajñāpāramitā, various other canonical texts including an Abhidharma commentary, and a substantial body of non-canonical writings such as the Maṇi Kambum, Pema Kathang, Klu 'bum anthologies, and biographies of figures such as Milarepa (Mi la ras pa, 1040–1123) and Rinchen Sangpo (Rin chen bzang po, 958–1055).",

The main text uses black ink on cream paper, while the opening pages are decorated with gold ink on dark blue paper.

The monastery houses what scholars have identified as a \"proto-Kanjur\"—an early, pre-standardized phase in the formation of the Tibetan Buddhist canon.\n\nFounded in 996 CE by the Guge king Lha Lama Yeshé Ö (Lha bla ma Ye shes 'od, c. 947–1024), Tabo Monastery is strongly associated with the influential translator Rinchen Sangpo (Rin chen bzang po, 958–1055). The surviving manuscripts were compiled over several centuries, with the oldest core dating to the 10th and 11th centuries and additions possibly made up to the 16th or 17th centuries. The antiquity of the collection is confirmed by palaeography, radiocarbon analysis, and a dedicatory note from Yeshé Ö dated to c. 1019.\n\nWestern scholarship first learned of the collection when August Francke visited Tabo in 1909 and reported vast heaps of disordered leaves, mainly Prajñāpāramitā texts. Giuseppe Tucci, who visited in 1933, noted its disarray but found evidence of a wider textual range. In 1991, Ernst Steinkellner initiated systematic research that clarified the collection’s scope and structure.\n\nThe Tabo Collection, as it survives, is profoundly fragmentary: about 35,000 loose folios remain, without a single intact text among them. Damage from fire and other causes is evident, suggesting these are the remnants of a far larger library—possibly assembled at Tabo when other western Himalayan monasteries declined.\n\nDistinct from standard Kanjurs, the Tabo collection epitomizes the \"proto-Kanjur\" phase, predating the canonical arrangement of the 14th century and best described as a \"collection of collections\" reflecting an earlier textual landscape. Approximately eighty percent of the manuscripts are Prajñāpāramitā sūtras, with the remainder consisting mainly of Sūtra texts, particularly from the Ratnakūṭa, Avataṃsaka, and Parinirvāṇa.

    "abstract": "The Tholing Collection (Mtho lding), also known as the Tholing Kanjur, is a significant yet fragmentary collection of Tibetan Buddhist canonical manuscripts that represents an early stage in the development and transmission of the Kanjur, particularly within Western Tibet's distinct textual tradition.\n\nThe manuscripts were recovered by the renowned Italian Tibetologist Giuseppe Tucci (1894–1984) during an early 20th-century expedition to Western Tibet. He found the collection in a state of neglect, piled in a grotto within the ruins above the main Tholing monastery. Tucci described the find as \"a whole library; the jumbled remains of ancient copies of the Kanjur and the Tanjur\". He collected approximately 3,000 folios, which are now a core part of the Tucci Tibetan Fund in the IsIAO Library in Rome. The collection's origin is tied to the historical importance of Tholing monastery, founded in 996. Tholing became the religious and cultural heart of the Guge kingdom and a center for the \"second diffusion\" of Buddhism in Tibet. This renaissance was spearheaded by figures like the great translator Rinchen Sangpo (Rin chen bzang po, 958–1055) and the Indian master Atiśa (982–1054), both active in the region under royal patronage. The Tholing manuscripts are dated to a period spanning the 11th to 15th centuries and are considered contemporary with or even earlier than the Old Narthang Kanjur, a conceptual archetype for later canonical editions.\n\nThe Tholing collection is not a complete, standardized Kanjur but rather a proto-Kanjur or an assembly of proto-canonical texts. It is characterized by its fragmentary nature and archaic features, including an inconsistent mix of old and new orthography and paleography. The manuscripts are considered highly valuable because they represent a distinct Western Tibetan line of transmission that predates and stands independent of the two main Central Tibetan Kanjur lineages—the Tshalpa and Thempangma—which were formalized in the 14th century. This makes the collection a crucial witness to the formative stages of the Tibetan canon before the establishment of standardized recensions.\n\nThough incomplete, the collection contains texts from nearly all major sections of a typical Kanjur, albeit in uneven quantities. While detailed analysis is ongoing, the known contents include a substantial portion of the Prajñāpāramitā, specifically the Śatasāhasrikāprajñāpāramitā, comprising 30 identified texts. The Sūtra and Dhāraṇī sections are also well-represented. Additionally, the find includes an incomplete Vinaya text, 11 texts from the Mahāratnakūṭa, three from the Mahāparinirvāṇasūtra, and a single Tantra text. The relative scarcity of Tantric texts is noteworthy, given Tholing's association with tantric specialists like Rinchen Sangpo.

    "abstract": "The Tsugolskiy Datsan Kanjur is a canonical collection central to the Buddhist heritage of the Buryat region of Transbaikalia, Russia. Historically housed at the Tsugol’skii Datsan (monastery), this Kanjur represents not just a textual corpus but a living symbol of Buryat Buddhist revival and cultural resilience.\n\nDuring the 19th and early 20th centuries, Buryat monasteries—including the Tsugol’skii Datsan—emerged as important centers for both the preservation and block printing of Buddhist texts. As detailed in Syrtypova (2016), block printing technology, mainly developed under Mongolian and Tibetan influence, flourished in Transbaikalia and nearby Buryatia, leading to the production of numerous canonical and ritual texts. Monasteries procured xylographic Kanjurs from Tibet and Mongolia, and also amassed manuscripts, which became prized possessions of major datsans. This contributed to the rich textual culture evident in the region’s Buddhist communities.\n\nThe Kanjur at Tsugol’skii Datsan was printed in dbu can, typically using local paper (sometimes also Chinese), and ink derived from lampblack or soot. Printing blocks were often carved by skilled artisans working at monasteries in Buryatia, Mongolia, or sometimes imported from famous workshops. The quality of craft and the vivid red and black inks used for auspicious or opening passages symbolized both book artistry and liturgical function.\n\nThe fate of the Tsugolskiy Datsan Kanjur reflects the turbulent modern history of Buddhism in Buryatia. The Soviet anti-religious campaigns led to widespread closures and destruction of datsans; many Kanjur sets were confiscated, lost, or transferred to state institutions. The Tsugolskiy Datsan Kanjur survived only thanks to the actions of laypeople, monks, and local academics who hid, protected, or relocated texts.\n\nIn 1996, the surviving 132 volumes of the Kanjur—previously held by a state museum in Ulan-Ude—were officially transferred to a monastic community, marking a milestone in the restoration of Buddhist material culture in Buryatia. This event symbolized the spiritual and institutional regeneration of the Buryat people; sacred texts, once treated as museum objects, returned to active liturgical use.\n\nThe Tsugolskiy Datsan Kanjur illustrates the unique position of Buryatia at the crossroads of Tibetan, Mongolian, and Russian Buddhist worlds. Block printing played a major role in ensuring the dissemination, transmission, and local adaptation of canonical texts. This tradition of textual production continues to underpin the revival of Buryat Buddhism today.",

    "abstract": "The Tsugolskiy Datsan Kanjur is a canonical collection central to the Buddhist heritage of the Buryat region of Transbaikalia, Russia. Historically housed at the Tsugol’skii Datsan (monastery), this Kanjur represents not just a textual corpus but a living symbol of Buryat Buddhist revival and cultural resilience.\n\nDuring the 19th and early 20th centuries, Buryat monasteries—including the Tsugol’skii Datsan—emerged as important centers for both the preservation and block printing of Buddhist texts. As detailed in Syrtypova (2016), block printing technology, mainly developed under Mongolian and Tibetan influence, flourished in Transbaikalia and nearby Buryatia, leading to the production of numerous canonical and ritual texts. Monasteries procured xylographic Kanjurs from Tibet and Mongolia, and also amassed manuscripts, which became prized possessions of major datsans. This contributed to the rich textual culture evident in the region’s Buddhist communities.\n\nThe Kanjur at Tsugol’skii Datsan was printed in dbu can, typically using local paper (sometimes also Chinese), and ink derived from lampblack or soot. Printing blocks were often carved by skilled artisans working at monasteries in Buryatia, Mongolia, or sometimes imported from famous workshops. The quality of craft and the vivid red and black inks used for auspicious or opening passages symbolized both book artistry and liturgical function.\n\nThe fate of the Tsugolskiy Datsan Kanjur reflects the turbulent modern history of Buddhism in Buryatia. The Soviet anti-religious campaigns led to widespread closures and destruction of datsans; many Kanjur sets were confiscated, lost, or transferred to state institutions. The Tsugolskiy Datsan Kanjur survived only thanks to the actions of laypeople, monks, and local academics who hid, protected, or relocated texts.\n\nIn 1996, the surviving 132 volumes of the Kanjur—previously held by a state museum in Ulan-Ude—were officially transferred to a monastic community, marking a milestone in the restoration of Buddhist material culture in Buryatia. This event symbolized the spiritual and institutional regeneration of the Buryat people; sacred texts, once treated as museum objects, returned to active liturgical use.\n\nThe Tsugolskiy Datsan Kanjur illustrates the unique position of Buryatia at the crossroads of Tibetan, Mongolian, and Russian Buddhist worlds. Block printing played a major role in ensuring the dissemination, transmission, and local adaptation of canonical texts. This tradition of textual production continues to underpin the revival of Buryat Buddhism today.",

This collection is not a distinct redaction, but rather a faithful copy of the Early Mustang Kanjur, a local canonical tradition rooted in the 15th century.\n\nThe Tsarang Kanjur descends from the Early Mustang Kanjur, compiled between 1436 and 1447 under the patronage of King Ama Pel (A ma dpal, c. 1380–1440) and overseen by the Sakya master Ngorchen Kunga Sangpo (Ngor chen kun dga’ bzang po, 1382–1456). The project was begun after it was reported that an even earlier Kanjur in Mustang had deteriorated such that \"no complete volume of the Kanjur existed in any one place\".

While known to exist, its details became widely accessible only after Lokesh Chandra’s 1959 study, following its ‘discovery’ by his father, Prof. Dr. Raghu Vira, who received a complete set in 1955 from Mongolia’s Prime Minister.\n\nThe carving of the Urga Kanjur’s woodblocks was commissioned by the 8th Khalkha Jetsun Dampa, Ngawang Lobsang Chökyi Nyima Tenzin Wangchuk (Ngag dbang blo bzang chos kyi nyi ma bstan ‘dzin dbang phyug, 1870–1924). After a hiatus, work resumed in 1908 and concluded in 1910. Production took place at Nomiin Ikh Khüree (M. nom-un yeke küriye(n)) Monastery, also known as Riwo Gegye Ganden Shedrubling (Ri bo dge rgyas dga’ ldan bshad sgrub gling) in Urga.\n\nToday, only a few complete sets are known, with holdings in Ulaanbaatar, Buryatia, and the International Academy of Indian Culture, New Delhi.\n\nThe Urga Kanjur is part of the Tshalpa transmission and based on the Derge Kanjur, following that edition’s text and layout closely—sometimes matching page-for-page and line-by-line. However, editorial changes and corrections were introduced, making it a distinct witness in the transmission of the Tibetan canon.\n\nThe Urga Kanjur consists of 105 volumes, differing from Derge due to editorial changes: one additional Mdo sde (Ki) volume in the Sūtra section; the Dri med ’od divided into two volumes; and the catalogue counted as a separate, final volume (vol. 105). The volumes themselves are relatively compact at about 60 x 11 cm.\n\nUrga’s editors primarily followed Situ Paṇchen Chökyi Jungné’s (Si tu paṇ chen Chos kyi ’byung gnas, 1700–1774) Derge catalogue, omitting later titles from the Tohoku catalogue not recorded in Situ Paṇchen’s original. Notably, the Urga Kanjur includes a unique Mdo sde (Ki) volume, featuring a text translated by Changkya Rölpé Dorjé (Lcang skya Rol pa’i rdo rje, 1717–1786), present only in some Narthang Kanjur sets. Section arrangement sometimes diverges from other known catalogues, reflecting the editors’ individual decisions. A comprehensive catalogue of the Urga Kanjur was compiled by Géza Bethlenfalvy and published in 1980.",

After a hiatus, work resumed in 1908 and concluded in 1910. Production took place at Nomiin Ikh Khüree (M. nom-un yeke küriye(n)) Monastery, also known as Riwo Gegye Ganden Shedrubling (Ri bo dge rgyas dga’ ldan bshad sgrub gling) in Urga.\n\nToday, only a few complete sets are known, with holdings in Ulaanbaatar, Buryatia, and the International Academy of Indian Culture, New Delhi.\n\nThe Urga Kanjur is part of the Tshalpa transmission and based on the Derge Kanjur, following that edition’s text and layout closely—sometimes matching page-for-page and line-by-line. However, editorial changes and corrections were introduced, making it a distinct witness in the transmission of the Tibetan canon.\n\nThe Urga Kanjur consists of 105 volumes, differing from Derge due to editorial changes: one additional Mdo sde (Ki) volume in the Sūtra section; the Dri med ’od divided into two volumes; and the catalogue counted as a separate, final volume (vol. 105). The volumes themselves are relatively compact at about 60 x 11 cm.\n\nUrga’s editors primarily followed Situ Paṇchen Chökyi Jungné’s (Si tu paṇ chen Chos kyi ’byung gnas, 1700–1774) Derge catalogue, omitting later titles from the Tohoku catalogue not recorded in Situ Paṇchen’s original. Notably, the Urga Kanjur includes a unique Mdo sde (Ki) volume, featuring a text translated by Changkya Rölpé Dorjé (Lcang skya Rol pa’i rdo rje, 1717–1786), present only in some Narthang Kanjur sets. Section arrangement sometimes diverges from other known catalogues, reflecting the editors’ individual decisions. A comprehensive catalogue of the Urga Kanjur was compiled by Géza Bethlenfalvy and published in 1980.",

    "abstract": "The Ulaanbaatar Thempangma Kanjur is a complete and well-preserved Tibetan manuscript collection held at the National Library of Mongolia in Ulaanbaatar. Recognized as a key witness to the Thempangma transmission lineage of the Tibetan Buddhist canon, it is written on thick glossy Tibetan paper in black ink, each folio measuring approximately 70.5 cm x 25 cm with a print area of 14.5 cm x 59 cm arranged in eight lines per page. Two distinctive horizontal circles are set in the middle of each page.\n\nThis manuscript, most commonly called the Ulaanbaatar Thempangma Kanjur to distinguish it from other Kanjurs in the city’s archives. The collection comprises 114 volumes, although, in the current digital edition, volumes 40, 41, and 56 are missing. The set was brought to Mongolia around 1671 as a gift to the first Jetsun Dampa Khutuktu, Lobsang Tenpé Gyaltsen (Blo bzang bstan pa’i rgyal mtshan, 1635–1723), from the 5th Dalai Lama. It is probable that its original catalogue volume was already missing at that time, and a new handwritten catalogue was later compiled for this collection.\n\nThis Kanjur is one of the five principal manuscript collections in the Thempangma group, stemming from a foundational manuscript compiled in Gyantse (rgyal rtse) around 1431. Its textual transmission is noteworthy for relying on handwritten copies rather than woodblock prints, and the Ulaanbaatar Thempangma Kanjur is valued for its close preservation of the original tradition.\n\nThe arrangement and titles of the texts in this edition show some variation from the other major Thempangma Kanjur editions—such as the Stog Palace, Shelkar (London), and Tokyo (Toyo Bunko) manuscripts. The present manuscript contains 833 titles, one fewer than found in the hand-list of Géza Bethlenfalvy, which was compiled from the Register (thob yig) of Dzaya Paṇḍita (Dz+ya paNDita, 1642–1708) as well as an earlier catalogue. Notably, several titles appear in these lists but are not found in the physical manuscript itself, and missing volumes are listed in accordance with consecutive numbers based on the Register of Dzaya Paṇḍita.\n\nSince 2007, the digitization of the Thempangma manuscript (rgyal rtse’i them spangs ma) has been a collaborative project led by the National Library of Mongolia, the Asian Classics Input Project (ACIP), and the Yuishoji Buddhist Cultural Exchange Research Institute (YBCERI), Tokyo. The process involved meticulous digital scanning, image processing, and verification, with the results published in a set of seven DVDs by the Digital Preservation Society, Tokyo. The digitization concluded in 2016, and the complete collection (aside from the three missing volumes, as described above) is now accessible internationally.

It is primarily a black-and-white manuscript, written in black ink, and distinct from the older, ornately decorated Golden Kanjur at Basgo. This collection is a conflated canon—assembled in the 20th century from a vast repository of much older manuscript fragments.\n\nWhile the present compilation dates to the 20th century, most constituent manuscripts are from the early 17th century, during the reigns of Jamyang Namgyal ('Jam dbyangs rnam rgyal, r. 1595–1616) and his son Sengge Namgyal (Seng ge rnam rgyal, r. 1616–1642). The Serzang Temple was founded by Jamyang Namgyal and enlarged by Sengge Namgyal, who made Basgo a major residence. Patronage by Sengge Namgyal and spiritual guidance from the Drukpa Kagyü master Taktsang Repa Ngawang Gyatso (Stag tshang ras pa Ngag dbang rgya mtsho, 1574–1651) shaped the production of these manuscripts. This ties the Basgo collection to the same historical context as Kanjurs at Hemis, Chemre, and Hanle.\n\nThe Basgo collection is not a unified production but the result of ongoing compilation. The current Kanjur was assembled in the 20th century, with a repair note from 1986, drawing from at least five or six different 17th-century Kanjur sets. Over 60,000 folios of source material survive at Basgo. Repeated re-pagination and movement of texts between volumes suggest multiple recompilations before the final 20th-century version. Missing folios were replaced by newly written ones, often of lower quality. The reviser Namkha Pelgön is frequently named in both sūtra and tantra sections, indicating his editorial role in the 17th century.\n\nThe Basgo Manuscript Kanjur stands outside the two main lines of Tibetan Kanjur transmission (the Tshalpa and Thempangma). It is a prominent example of the Mustang group, sharing close ties with the Hemis Kanjur and considered a descendant of the Early Mustang Kanjur (mid-15th century). This reflects a unique transmission lineage for the Western Himalayas. Because it does not derive from central Tibetan prototypes, it is classified as a local or independent canon, providing crucial insights into the diversity of Kanjur traditions.\n\nPhysically, the 17th-century manuscripts are written in dbu can script on coarse, brownish paper, lack earlier-period string holes, and feature an elaborate ornamental headmark (yig mgo). The collection includes a substantial tantra section, much larger than the related Hemis Kanjur, although this section is in significant disarray. It also preserves archaic textual versions and rare works, some paralleling collections from Dölpo and Batang.\n\nAmong the 17th-century manuscripts are approximately 900 folios from a proto-canonical collection of the 14th or early 15th century, displaying archaic orthography and palaeographic features.

    "abstract": "The Basgo Golden Kanjur is an ornate Tibetan canonical manuscript preserved at Basgo, Ladakh. Written in gold ink (chrysography), it is one of several distinct Kanjur collections at Basgo, alongside 17th-century black-and-white manuscripts. This edition was commissioned by King Tashi Namgyal (Bkra shis rnam rgyal, r. c. 1555–1575) and his wife, as recorded in a colophon from a golden Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā sutra manuscript in Basgo. This places its origin in the mid-to-late 16th century, distinguishing it from the 17th-century Basgo Kanjur.\n\nCreation of luxurious Buddhist scriptures was integral to Ladakhi royal culture. The Ladakhi kings, including King Tashi Namgyal and King Sengge Namgyal (Seng ge rnam rgyal, c. 1570–1642), dedicated significant gold revenues from Guge and Rudok to produce such manuscripts and plated stupas. The manuscript belongs to the Namgyal dynasty, which established its first capital at Basgo, and is considered one of the community’s most revered possessions.\n\nAlthough the identities of specific editors or translators are not documented, the materials and artistry are notable. The manuscript is written on dark blue-black paper (mthing shog), traditionally made in Lingshed, Ladakh, by laminating layers of Daphne paper. The calligraphy employs a bamboo pen and ink from finely powdered gold, a practice often mastered by Newar artisans.\n\nThe Basgo Golden Kanjur is incomplete and probably housed in the Serzang Lhakhang at Basgo. As of 2008–2011, the Kanjur was kept secure in a locked metal trunk, not on display. Its incomplete state is likely the result of the fate common to such collections: folios were lost, damaged, or removed for amulets or sale.",

    "abstract": "The Yongle Kanjur is the first-ever printed edition of the Tibetan Buddhist canon, produced by imperial command in Beijing in 1410 under the Yongle Emperor of the Ming dynasty (r. 1402–1424). Printed in distinctive red cinnabar ink, it marks a foundational moment for xylographic technology and canonical transmission, establishing the precedent for the \"Peking line\" of Kanjur editions.\n\nThe Yongle Kanjur was commissioned as part of the emperor’s diplomatic overtures to Central Tibetan authorities, including inviting key religious figures to the Ming court and cultivating Sino-Tibetan political and spiritual relations. Its production, far more than a devotional act, was a calculated political move: demonstrating Ming technological power, expressing respect for Tibetan Buddhism, and asserting imperial authority over Buddhist scripture. Unlike later editions, it was produced in very limited quantity; the blocks themselves were preserved by the Ming court as authoritative imperial standards rather than for mass printing.\n\nCompiled from a manuscript exemplar of the Tshalpa Kanjur, the Yongle edition belongs squarely to the Tshalpa transmission lineage. Its production entailed the engraving of over 35,000 wooden plates, most likely executed at Fayuan-si temple in Beijing. A nearly identical reprint, the Wanli Kanjur (printed 1605–1606 in black ink), was commissioned by the Wanli Emperor, confirming that the original blocks had been preserved.\n\nFew sets were ever printed. Presently, only two nearly complete Yongle Kanjurs survive, both in Lhasa:  \n- One, originally given to Kunga Tashi (Kun dga’ bkra shis, 1349–1425) of the Sakya school in 1414 and transferred to the Potala Palace.\n- A second, offered to Jamchen Chöje Śakya Yeshé (Byams chen Chos rjes shākya ye shes, 1352/54-1435) founder of the Sera monastery in 1416, now held at Sera, containing 103 extant volumes.  \nA third set placed at Dawenshu Temple, Wutai-shan, is now lost. A single leaf survives at the University of Michigan.\n\nMost sources list the Yongle Kanjur as comprising 105 or 106 volumes plus a catalogue, though a count of 108 is sometimes reported. The catalogue carries a title almost identical to that of the Old Narthang Kanjur's, suggesting continuity in cataloguing tradition.\n\nThe physical layout is distinctive: thin vertical lines along the folio borders separate the Tibetan text from marginal notes, with Chinese annotations elegantly placed, reflecting the edition’s Sino-Tibetan context.\n\nThe Yongle Kanjur is a landmark in the history of Buddhist textual culture—introducing printing technology to canon production, reinforcing Sino-Tibetan relations, and establishing a stable Tshalpa textual witness for all later \"Peking line\" editions (Wanli Kanjur 1606, Peking 1684–92, and others).",

A key witness to the Thempangma transmission, it is distinguished by its composite structure and unique regional features.\n\nProduced in the context of Ladakhi royal patronage, the Shey Kanjur is physically associated with the Shey Palace complex, the foundation of which dates to 1647. Evidence within the colophons links the manuscript's completion to the reign of King Nyima Namgyal (Nyi ma rnam rgyal, r. 1691–1729), with volume notes mentioning dates such as 1729 and 1732 and dedicatory wishes addressed to the king. This places the Shey Kanjur roughly contemporaneous with the Stog Palace Kanjur, another royal commission in Ladakh.

These short notes reveal a collaborative approach: pairs of revisers from Zanskar (zangs dkar pa) and Stog (stog pa), with reading and checking roles, and scribes such as Ringmo of Likir.
